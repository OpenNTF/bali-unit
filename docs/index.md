# LotusScript Testing Framework

VoltScript Testing Framework is a framework for testing code written using VoltScript, the evolution of LotusScript delivered as part of HCL Volt MX Go. This framework has been adapted for LotusScript.

There are deliberately no dependencies on any LotusScript Extensions (LSX, e.g nlsxbe.dll). None should be added, it will make it dependent on a particular implementation.

## Using in an NSF
